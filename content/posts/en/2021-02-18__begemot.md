Hippos are very rude animals.

Never offer a hippo to drink water or tea, sit down or help bring bags. Hippos are self-sufficient and proud, if you hurt their feelings, they can offend you.

Hippos are especially touchy in summer, when it is +50 degrees outside. They go under the water, and whisper there about all the passers-by.
